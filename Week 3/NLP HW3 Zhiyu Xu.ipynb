      "this product is dependant on several outside factors. the reception your car gets and the availability of a clear fm channel. to rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. there were times when i had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. i love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but i'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n",

      "with boys aged 2 & 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when i'm driving, it appeared i was in need of one of these units.  generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car i don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  i read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but i found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  i'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n",

      "i bought these headphones a week ago and i am very pleased with them. at the electronic store, i listen to 3 pairs of sennheiser (hd-433 ; hd-437 and hd-457). i hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). at the store the sound was ok as they were playing from the sennheiser display rack. when i got home, i plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. i am very impressed of the volume and sound quality i can get from them on my computer. my soundcard is an onboard soundmax ac97 on an asus k8v-x motherboard. i set the sound option in windows xp on \"headphones\" and played \"metallica- nothing else matters\" with winamp. wow !!! i was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. i only use half of the volume available in windows xp and it`s more than enough for me.\n",
      "i do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but i found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. the sound is better on  my computer than on my harman kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my mp3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\n",
      "overall, i would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. they blow away all the competition in the same price range. compared to my old panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\n",
      "when it comes to music, i love bass a lot but i would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\n",

      "i recently received the zen microphoto as a gift.  since i travel fairly often, i decided to purchase the traveldock after reading the reviews.  it's great.  the microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  the sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that i own.  many people comment on the bass issue.  for travel speakers, the traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  true bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from creative's website).  i'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  the jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  also, the microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  there's even an attachable fm antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  by the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between fm and mp3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/ff/rew.  overall, this is a very nice addition to the zen microphoto.\n",

      "learning how to put them in properly takes time.  be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  some tips: before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. with one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  this straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) you may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  if the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n",

(same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n",

      "my experience: i've had two pairs of these for over a year and i like them very much. i enjoy great sound watching tv or listening to music while everybody is asleep. this is really great, i can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. the sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the tv. you have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the tv (closet or the garage for example). the headphones are light and very comfortable. i tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. so, overall wonderful product. however, there a few flaws to be aware of. consider the following before buying. it might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. sometimes, turning the headphones on results in poor reception if any at all. to correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. you might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. the last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). you need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. that is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. you think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. well, i hope my description is helpful. \n",

      "i have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart i decided it was time to upgrade.  i wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  i shopped around and came to the conclusion i would aim for the form factor speakers.  when considering this bose system, this must be taken into account.    \n",
      "\n",
      "first off, this system is expensive.  for just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  at this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n",
      " \n",
      "what brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  for their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n",
      "\n",
      "once i got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  the only serious issue i have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "since i do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) i had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, i was extremely please with the system.  with a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n",
      "\n",
      "my test soundtracks included:  gladiator, matrix (ii or iii), snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  the second complaint i have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  i found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  that was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n",

      "e- quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today, you are buying chinese c*** (junk).  both the manufacturing and quality control (qc) are garbage.  unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  if you are expecting \"made in japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  this is the reason you will see many brand name goods, also selling with no-name labels (i.e coby).  same production line, different labels.  it is also one of the reason folks are impressed with apple ipods.  apple demands excellent qc, and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  in exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of qc.  like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n",

      "first off, let me say that this is a very impressive monitor.  my points of reference for that statement are my other three lcd monitors: three samsung models, two of which are 913ns and the other is a 712n.  these two samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this viewsonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this viewsonic.  surprisingly, i actually can see the brightness difference between the samsungs and this viewsonic, but, for my taste and needs, the samsungs are simply too bright, and i end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  for high light, daytime use, i have found that i do like to have the brightness all the way up on the viewsonic, but i truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the viewsonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation cd, even though the driver package that is posted on the viewsonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  when i first installed this monitor and turned it on, i truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the samsung monitors that i own.  but, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the viewsonic screen contrast was set much lower than the maximum setting.  when i increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, i believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other lcds that i own.\n",
      "\n",
      "one big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a dvi cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all viewsonics).  and, especially with the digital connection, i have no doubts about viewsonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the samsungs.  i have to admit that i wasn't sure i needed a widescreen display, but i believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  this is a really a fine monitor!\n",
      "\n",
      "now for a few small negatives.  one reason i haven't purchased viewsonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  i already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so i really have no use for monitor speakers.  additionally, those viewsonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than i'm comfortable with.  strains my neck.  the reason i really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other viewsonic monitors.  with that said, i have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than i had expected.  for example, on the 17 inch samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  on the 19 inch samsungs, it is 4 inches.  on this viewsonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  it's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  if all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n",
      "\n",
      "as with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  the 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  the .pdf manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  however, i found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "all in all, i'm very impressed so far, and i'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  by the by, shipping from amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  i can't complain about that speed!  my only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  go figure!  anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n",

      "however, be sure to update the firmware or the ap might not work correctly.  when i first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my netgear and hp centrino notebook.  both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an ip address from my network's dns server.  a firmware upgrade solved the problem and the ap now streams tv realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\n",

      "\n",
      "i initially wanted the klipsch promedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's promedia 4.1's (which neither i nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n",

      "so... through all this i eventually came to the conclusion that altec langsing was the brand i wanted to go with. and if that was so, it had to be the fx6021's which i had been eyeing for years. the first time i heard them in a store i declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. these are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 pc speakers you can buy. even at their msrp of $250 they're probably worth it. these speakers a very nice!\n",

      "this is the ultimate ears super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. i don't think ue would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "on the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones i've ever used, the quality is excellent. the bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. this overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the ue 5 eb's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. for music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. with rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but i have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "it should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the eb's a good choice for people who own ipods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. without any eq adjustment, the ipod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is present. \n",
      "\n",
      "in terms of build, the eb's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. i have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. be careful out there! thoughtfully, eb has includes a variety of ear tips with these iem's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. the eb's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. on the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. however, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the eb's.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh, and some people think that the eb's look kind of strange when worn. larger than the higher-priced super fi 5 pro model, the eb's stick out a bit. your call as to whether this is a problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "it's unlikely that the eb's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. the truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the super fi 5 pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (i own both). but as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the eb's are well-designed and definitely fun\n",

      "1. it is only good in the united states (including washington, dc, but minus maine), but it does not include guam, virgin islands, etc. so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + d.c., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. they will only fix/replace/etc if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. that is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. if the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. if the item is being replaced, \"you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center. reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you.\" i'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer's warranty do not apply.\" (doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of god\" ... sorry, i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). but, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "so, now that i have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, please read the contract since i didn't cover everything!!! (don't hold me liable since i don't have much money anyways.) also, i think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, i would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). i didn't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

      "the v200 is another great logitech product. it is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. it takes two aa batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. the mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. this is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. with the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. overall the design is good. there could be a problem installing setpoint. it may hang on install. if so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. it should work. the usb receiver is 2.4 ghz and has a 10 meter range. wow. however there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. usb dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. for this reason you should have the usb receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. it should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. if you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 ghz receiver. so okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. the receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. when it is in the holder the mouse turns off. it doesn't fit in smoothly. it creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. the other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. i am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. if you are then a mouse like this and usb should last for a very long time. there is really nothing wrong with it. wireless mini mouse. fab! however there is one last thing to say. if you don't like the idea of a usb receiver then get a bluetooth version of this mouse instead. it is called the v270. that is if your notebook has internal bluetooth or else you will need to get a bluetooth usb receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your usb receivers. but if you have a bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the v270 and forget about this usb option. the usb design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. you just got to switch to internal bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n",

      "the reason my reviews of paul mccartney and john lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''economy class beatles'' george harrison's and ringo starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what hd-600's reveal. my main source of media tends to be vinyl, because compact discs and dvd's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. and when listening to badly recorded albums, hd-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. hd-600's are the reason i mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying lennon and mccartney solo albums. listening to ''take it away'' from 1982's tug of war reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. it sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and geoff emerick or george martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n",
      "\n",
      "it gets much worse than 'take it away' on paul mccartney albums, and even more painfully so on john lennon albums. but listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums back to the egg, ram, double fantasy, milk and honey, and some portions of band on the run, and walls and bridges. #9 dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n",

      "when you listen to your cd's, vinyl, dvd's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear how those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. on speakers, mccartney's jet sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. but when hearing the album with hd-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. mccartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on bass. \n",

      "i am greatly impressed with this unit.  it was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a gps unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the gps satellites.  this can take a few minutes.) in any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever i turned it on.\n",

      "one highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for points of interest (poi), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  this allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - \"let your fingers do the walking...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "if you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a point of interest.  i didn't know which city to specify and i did a search for \"eagle rock rec\" (i was too lazy to spell out \"eagle rock recreation center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  i later realized that even though i didn't know the exact city the destination was in, i did know a city that was near the desired destination.  when i specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n",

      "the advanced user can also create your own poi lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  i have done this for all in-n-out burger and krispy kreme locations.  the advantage to having your own custom pois even though these places are in the built-in poi list is that the custom pois are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  if you are a geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "the newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but i found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since i have limited my indoor driving lately :-). i haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so i might change my tune.  the comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n",

      "since i already have a garmin handheld gps unit as well as garmin's mapsource topo mapping software, i used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my mapsource maps for the unit. i then loaded the topo maps for the entire western us onto an sd card (between 300-500 mb) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  it worked!  so now i have the c340's excellent built-in maps and pois for on-road trips *and* topo maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n",

      "there's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this sony dvd player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/us/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=dvpns90v&loc=3. i've been running this sony dvp-ns90v player through a sony widescreen hdtv and a pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and i find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. one, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 db to +5 db (see page 77 of the manual). whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think sacd's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. i, for one, prefer dvd-audio, and i mention this for an important reason: some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will not play dvd-audio discs.\" happy surprize: it most certainly will! for my dvd-a's that have optional dolby 5.1 and/or dts tracks, the player simply ignores the primary dvd-a format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the dolby or the dts via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. for \"pure\" dvd-a's (without dolby 5.1 or dts tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio both via the 6 analog and the digital connectors. and in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel pcm, nor prologic pseudo-surround. the only dvd-a function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on dvd-a's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. the quick setup allows any dvd newbie to be up and running in a short time. and the custom setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. in short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n",

      "having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, i can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. the drivers at least for mac os x are easy to understand and reliable. the ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. however, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. by using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. as an artist and graphic designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. the only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. but what inkjet dosen't have that problem? anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. so any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. so i'm giving 5 stars on the epson 128\n",

      "this dock basically serves three purposes:\n",
      "- the traditional synch & charge function available since the early days.\n",
      "- it helps you get \"line\" output out of an ipod.  line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  it is the best way to connect your ipod to a home stereo or home theater.\n",
      "- the super video out for color ipods.  this function is something you cannot get without the dock.  so, if you like to show your pictures to your friends & family using a hi-res tv (plasma, lcd or a flat screen) this is a great tool to use.  as an alternative, if you do not want to use s-video and are ok with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"apple ipod av cable\" at $19 from the apple store or similar alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "in summary, buy this if you hook your ipod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your tv.  if you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the ipod box\n",

      "i think this is the safest for car use.  the itrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the ipod.  so if you're taking a car trip (i live in ny but went to college in mi -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the itrip.  the tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that i got for it didn't work).  also, you can tune into any fm station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  the icarplay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  though i feel limited by the 8, i don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  i like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  the other limitation i see is its ipod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  but considering i bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n",

      "i've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. they've included koss \"the plug,\" sennheiser px100, koss ur29, koss sportapro and a few others. all had their strong and weak points. so far, this has been the closest i've had to a good balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "for my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. the px100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old sony mdr-nc20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). i had problems keeping \"the plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the plug seats\" advice. they're also a very a bad choice for ipods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. the sportapros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. the ur29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. going back a few years, i had a pair of akg k240s that had disappointing bass. ditto for a pair of sennheiser hd-420s.\n",
      "\n",
      "the k26p seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. the bass is among the strongest. when i listen to the 1812 overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. isolation isn't as good as the ur29, but not too bad. certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. the px100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. the higher efficiency of the k26p means i can set my ipod at a lower volume. instead of 55-60% of max volume with the ur29 or the stock earbuds, i now run at 35-40% comfortably. in terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. if they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then gently straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. after a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. be patient. so it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. you'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. you'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. if the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. i hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. all they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. other phones with similar headbands (like the koss sportapro/portapro) don't use these pads, so i don't think they're really necessary. better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. it has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. in fact, without the pads, i barely feel the headband at all.\n",

      "i initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the sony srf-m37v because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  however, the srf-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on fm.  it's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  with this in mind, i purchased another srf-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  i literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed i was having so much fun scanning the fm dial.  there was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  over the course of a three hour listening session, i gradually cranked up the volume.  as i was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the srf-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (i understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  the party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  i also made one pass through the am band and there the srf-59 was no slouch either.  i hauled in 1200 woai san antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  though no true dx machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the am band as well (i suspect early in the evening am dxing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  for more on this model and others visit xin feng's website.  i highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         \n",

      "i got these to replace some aging sony mdr-v2's that i purchased maybe 10 years ago.  the ear cushions of the mdr-v2's had begun to deteriorate, and i figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  i just compared them to the older v2s and i can say that the v6 is definitely better.  they fully surround the ears (v2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  the v6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  i concur that they sound a little bright, but i can take care of this on my ipod by setting the eq to reducetreble (but i like the brightness, so sometimes i don't do that).  i do not concur with other review comments about weak bass.  they appear to have the right amount.  (imho - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  i also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the ipod - and i listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\n",
      "as a last comment, i notice amazon has these for about $65.  i paid $99 at a local store.  buy from amazon !  (no - i don't work for or invest in them ;-\n",
      " \n",
      "i bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and i agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. by the way, i've owned the sony mdr-v600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. these have been used by musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n",

      "\n",
      "the good: they are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. if you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but i think that's the best you can expect from any pair. while listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. there is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. you put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n",
      "\n",
      "the bad: nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. the earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. however, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. i do this daily when i use them. however, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n",
      "\n",
      "other thoughts: the cord is plenty long enough to reach an ipod or whatever at about belt level. however, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. also, i often wear it when i'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. i had an issue once because i was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. when i stood up, i stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- i began to get a slight buzz in one ear. however, i blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n",

(all of that at the same time) granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. the strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. the strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if i wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).\n",

      "\n",
      "3) battery life. i'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. i get about 30-35 hours of use when i'm on the road using the aa's. when at home or in a hotel, the ac adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n",

      "\n",
      "- sturdy wires. this headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. the wire is very thick and long. also, it's single wire format.\n",
      "\n",
      "cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- ear padding is perhaps, too soft. this means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. so note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. if you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "- as some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. so be cautious of your movements.\n",

      "- you might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. but this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\n",

      "if you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. i did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since i nearly got it.\n",
      "\n",
      "some notes on the contract:\n",
      "1. it is only good in the united states (including washington, dc, but minus maine), but it does not include guam, virgin islands, etc. so if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + d.c., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
      "2. this contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
      "3. they will only fix/replace/etc if the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. that is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
      "4. if the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. if the item is being replaced, \"you will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered product to our authorized service center. reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to you.\" i'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
      "5. no lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the same defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. repairs performed while the product is under manufacturer's warranty do not apply.\" (doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
      "6. there are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of god\" ... sorry, i had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). but, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "so, now that i have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, please read the contract since i didn't cover everything!!! (don't hold me liable since i don't have much money anyways.) also, i think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, i would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). i didn't get the coverage because the product i was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

      "i was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  now that i bought it, i'm very glad i have it.  it does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), ac, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  while some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  between the am, fm, tv, and noaa bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (i didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  it comes in a carrying case.\n",
      "only minor criticisms:  the case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the ac adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). however, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\n",

      "\n",
      "i'm very pleased with my little ique m5 gps/pda.  while it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. i had actually purchased a lowrence iway 350 gps, but then my husband discovered the ique on sale at costco for about [...] more.  with the ique offering so many more features, i returned the lowrence and purchased the ique.  with my husband and i both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over bluetooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "it has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the pda, are limited. my husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the gps, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  it's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the lowrence.  we purchased a 2 gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  i had no trouble downloading the maps or the active sync software.  the basic gps functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  you can plan your route in advance without having the gps activated.  this is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "i used the gps on a trip stratford, canada, and it was wonderful having the canadian maps as well as the us maps available. i even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the avon river!), but it's generally right on target and i find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. the \"route to home\" feature is very convenient. granted, the ique doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like i am, it becomes indispensible.\n",

      "i've spent more time learning the pda portion, which uses windows mobile 2003 2nd edition. the ique uses outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. not having used outlook before, i installed outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n",
      "\n",
      "the pda has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  it will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the internet if you get a wi-fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other bluetooth units, sends alarms, has word and excel, even has a couple of good games.  i got a separate sd card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  it uses windows media player so you can organize all of your playlists.  you can download any programs that are available for windows mobile 2003, including tv shows and videos.  i never thought i'd find much use for a pda but i'm using it every day.  no more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an ipod.  everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. and even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n",

      "as far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  the buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n",

      "1) when the cartridges dry out, it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. this was confusing as i did have the correct cartridges in the printer. a \"replace cartridge\" message would have been less ambiguous.\n",

      "\n",
      "here are the ins and outs:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) solid construction. as others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". this, alone, surprised me. not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so i'm glad to see that this one was. belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) software. do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the cd that comes with it. instead, go directly to belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the cd, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "i've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part i have trouble with the most). the applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. kudos to belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) sticky keys. most people have experienced this.. myself included. being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time i went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and i've never had it happen since. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) other buttons. \n",
      "* the mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and i don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n",
      "* the orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, i use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games i play). it's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n",
